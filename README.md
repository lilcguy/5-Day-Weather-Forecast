# 5 Day Weather Forecast

## Description

This application allows a user to search for a city and then view its current weather and forecast for the next 5 days. This project was created for the practice of using and chaining API calls. In this project, I hit an API that retrieves latitude and longitude coordinates from a city search. Each of these city searches is saved into localStorage and added to the page. Then, I used the lat/lon coordinates received from that API to hit another API that retrieves a 5 day weather forecast that increments every three hours. I also used those lat/lon coordinates to hit another API for the current weather. Then, I used JS to dynamically populate the results of the forecast in the HTML. After conmpleting this project, I feel much more comfortable handling promises and .then() chains, and dealing with the data received from an API, and I am left with a practical tool that I can use whenever.

## Usage

Simply visit the HTML page in your browser, input a city in the search area, click submit, and watch the HTML populate with the current weather and 5 day forecast!
